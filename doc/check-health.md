Notify about health state
=========================

[◀ Go back to main README](../README.md)

> ℹ️ **Info**: This script can not be used on its own but requires the base
> installation. See [main README](../README.md) for details.

Description
-----------

This script is run from scheduler periodically, sending notification on
health related events:

* voltage jumps up or down more than configured threshold or drops below limit
* power supply failed or recovered
* temperature is above or below threshold

Note that bad initial state will not trigger an event.

Only sensors available in hardware can be checked. See what your
hardware supports:

    /system/health/print;

### Sample notifications

#### Voltage

![check-health notification voltage](check-health.d/notification-01-voltage.avif)

#### Temperature

![check-health notification](check-health.d/notification-02-temperature-high.avif)  
![check-health notification](check-health.d/notification-03-temperature-ok.avif)

#### PSU state

![check-health notification](check-health.d/notification-04-psu-fail.avif)  
![check-health notification](check-health.d/notification-05-psu-ok.avif)

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

Just install the script and create a scheduler:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate check-health;
    /system/scheduler/add interval=1m name=check-health on-event="/system/script/run check-health;" start-time=startup;

Configuration
-------------

The configuration goes to `global-config-overlay`, these are the parameters:

* `CheckHealthTemperature`: an array specifying temperature thresholds for sensors
* `CheckHealthVoltageLow`: value (in volt*10) giving a hard lower limit
* `CheckHealthVoltagePercent`: percentage value to trigger voltage jumps

Also notification settings are required for
[e-mail](mod/notification-email.md),
[matrix](mod/notification-matrix.md) and/or
[telegram](mod/notification-telegram.md).
