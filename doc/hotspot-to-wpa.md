Description
-----------

RouterOS supports an unlimited number of MAC address specific passphrases
for WPA2 encrypted wifi networks via access list. The idea of this script
is to transfer hotspot credentials to MAC address specific WPA2 passphrase.

Requirements and installation
-----------------------------

You need a properly configured hotspot on one (open) SSID and a WP2 enabled
SSID with suffix "`-wpa`".

Then install the script:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate hotspot-to-wpa;

Configure your hotspot to use this script as `on-login` script:

    /ip/hotspot/user/profile/set on-login=hotspot-to-wpa [ find ];

### Automatic cleanup

With just `hotspot-to-wpa` installed the mac addresses will last in the
access list forever. Install the optional script for automatic cleanup:

    $ScriptInstallUpdate hotspot-to-wpa-cleanup,lease-script;

Create a scheduler:

    /system/scheduler/add interval=1d name=hotspot-to-wpa-cleanup on-event="/system/script/run hotspot-to-wpa-cleanup;" start-time=startup;

And add the lease script to your wpa interfaces' dhcp server:

    /ip/dhcp-server/set lease-script=lease-script [ find where name~"wpa" ];

Configuration
-------------

On first run a disabled access list entry acting as marker (with comment
"`--- hotspot-to-wpa above ---`") is added. Move this entry to define where new
entries are to be added.

Create hotspot login credentials:

    /ip/hotspot/user/add comment="Test User 1" name=user1 password=v3ry;
    /ip/hotspot/user/add comment="Test User 2" name=user2 password=s3cr3t;

Additionally templates can be created to give more options for access list:

* `action`: set to `reject` to ignore logins on that hotspot
* `private-passphrase`: do **not** use passphrase from hotspot's user
  credentials, but given one - or unset (use default passphrase) with
  special word `ignore`
* `ssid-regexp`: set a different SSID regular expression to match
* `vlan-id`: connect device to specific VLAN
* `vlan-mode`: set the VLAN mode for device

For a hotspot called `example` the template could look like this:

    /caps-man/access-list/add comment="hotspot-to-wpa template example" disabled=yes private-passphrase="ignore" ssid-regexp="^example\$" vlan-id=10 vlan-mode=use-tag;

The same settings are available in hotspot user's comment and take precedence
over the template settings:

    /ip/hotspot/user/add comment="private-passphrase=ignore, ssid-regexp=^example\\\$, vlan-id=10, vlan-mode=use-tag" name=user password=v3ry-s3cr3t;

Usage and invocation
--------------------

Now let the users connect and login to the hotspot. After that the devices
(identified by MAC address) can connect to the WPA2 network, using the
passphrase from hotspot credentials.
